5 steps Getting Things Done

1. Capture: gather everything that's on your mind in a **capture bucket**.
2. Clarify: determine whether something is actionable or not.
3. Organize: place it in the right place (e.g. project folder, calendar).
4. Reflect: review your folders and lists frequently.
5. Engage: do what's actionable based on context, time, energy, priority.
