準備一個地方，隨時寫下自己的靈感，以便第二大腦稍後處理。

Have a place to put all the ideas that flash into your mind. Don’t worry too much about how you write it down or what you write. Just take them down.

The key is to “Capture” everything you have and put it into your external system for processing later on.

我自己目前打算用 Keep 當作我的靈感筆記。
